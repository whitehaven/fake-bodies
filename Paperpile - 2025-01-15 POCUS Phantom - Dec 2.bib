  abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: Ultrasound-guided intervention is an essential
                  skill for many radiologists and critical for accurate
                  diagnosis and treatment in many radiology subspecialties.
                  Simulation using phantoms have demonstrated statistically
                  significant benefits for trainees within the literature. We
                  propose a novel phantom model which the authors feel is ideal
                  for training clinical radiology trainees in the performance of
                  ultrasound-guided procedures. METHODS: The recipe to prepare a
                  homemade phantom is described. Results of a local survey from
                  trainees preparing and using the phantom are also presented.
                  RESULTS: This realistic training simulation model can be
                  adapted to suit a variety of biopsy devices and procedures
                  including soft tissue biopsy and cyst aspiration. The phantom
                  mimics the sonographic appearances of soft tissue and biopsy
                  targets can be concealed within. The phantom was easily
                  prepared by 22 trainees (Likert score 4.5) and it functioned
                  well (Likert score of 4.7). CONCLUSION: In summary, our
                  phantom model is ideal for training clinical radiology
                  trainees in the performance of ultrasound-guided core biopsy.
                  The availability and low cost of the model, combined with the
                  ease of preparation and reproducibility, make this an
                  efficient and effective addition to the training process.
                  ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: A low cost easily handmade phantom
                  recipe is described that could be easily implemented in
                  training schemes.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has emerged as an
                  essential bedside tool for clinicians, but lack of access to
                  ultrasound equipment has been a top barrier to POCUS use.
                  Recently, several handheld ultrasound devices ("handhelds")
                  have become available, and clinicians are seeking data to
                  guide purchasing decisions. Few comparative studies of
                  different handhelds have been done. We conducted a
                  cross-sectional study comparing 6 handhelds readily available
                  in the United States (Butterfly iQ + ™ by Butterfly Network
                  Inc.; Clarius™ by Clarius Mobile Health; Kosmos™ by EchoNous;
                  TE Air™ by Mindray; Vscan Air™ SL and CL by General Electric;
                  and Lumify™ by Philips Healthcare). A multi-specialty group of
                  physician POCUS experts (n = 35) acquired three standard
                  ultrasound views (abdominal right upper quadrant, cardiac
                  apical 4-chamber, and superficial neck and lung views) in
                  random order on the same standardized patients and rated the
                  image quality. Afterward, a final survey of the overall ease
                  of use, image quality, and satisfaction of each handheld was
                  completed. RESULTS: Thirty-five POCUS experts specializing in
                  internal medicine/hospital medicine, critical care, emergency
                  medicine, and nephrology acquired and rated right upper
                  quadrant, apical 4-chamber, and superficial neck and lung
                  views with 6 different handhelds. For image quality, the
                  highest-rated handhelds were Vscan Air™ for the right upper
                  quadrant view, Mindray TE Air™ for the cardiac apical
                  4-chamber view, and Lumify™ for superficial views of the neck
                  and lung. Overall satisfaction with image quality was highest
                  with Vscan Air™, Lumify™, and Mindray, while overall
                  satisfaction with ease of use was highest with Vscan Air™. The
                  5 most desirable characteristics of handhelds were image
                  quality, ease of use, portability, probe size, and battery
                  life. Ultimately, all 6 handhelds had notable advantages and
                  disadvantages, with no single device having all desired
                  qualities or features. CONCLUSIONS: The overall satisfaction
                  with image quality was rated highest with Vscan Air™, Lumify™,
                  and Mindray TE Air™when acquiring right upper quadrant, apical
                  4-chamber, and superficial neck and lung views. No single
                  handheld was perceived to be superior in image quality for all
                  views. Vscan Air™ was rated highest for overall ease of use
                  and was the most preferred handheld for purchase by POCUS
                  experts.},

                  ultrasound (US)-guided central venous catheter (CVC) insertion
                  skills on a partial task trainer improves cannulation and
                  insertion success rates in clinical practice. METHOD: This
                  prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind study of
                  first- and second-year residents occurred at a tertiary care
                  teaching hospital from January 2007 to September 2008. The
                  intervention group (n = 90) received a didactic and hands-on,
                  competency-based simulation training course in US-guided CVC
                  insertion, whereas the control group (n = 95) received
                  training through a traditional, bedside apprenticeship model.
                  Success at first cannulation and successful CVC insertion
                  served as the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included
                  reduction in technical errors and decreased mechanical
                  complications. RESULTS: Blinded independent raters observed
                  495 CVC insertions by 115 residents over a 21-month period.
                  Successful first cannulation occurred in 51\% of the
                  intervention group versus 37\% of the control group (P = .03).
                  CVC insertion success occurred for 78\% of the intervention
                  group versus 67\% of the control group (P = .02). Simulation
                  training was independently and significantly associated with
                  success at first cannulation (odds ratio: 1.7; 95\% confidence
                  interval: 1.1-2.8) and with successful CVC insertion (odds
                  ratio: 1.7; 95\% confidence interval: 1.1-2.8)--both
                  independent of US use, patient comorbidities, or resident
                  specialty. No significant differences related to technical
                  errors or mechanical complications existed between the two
                  groups. CONCLUSIONS: Simulation training was associated with
                  improved in-hospital performance of CVC insertion. Procedural
                  simulation was associated with improved residents' skills and
                  was more effective than traditional training.},

  abstract     = {PURPOSE: Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are common
                  congenital heart malformations. Echocardiography used during
                  VSD hybrid cardiac procedures requires extensive training for
                  image acquisition and interpretation. Cardiac surgery
                  simulators with heart phantoms have shown usefulness for such
                  training, but they are limited in visualization and
                  characterization of complex VSD. This study explores a new
                  method to build patient-specific heart phantoms with VSD, with
                  proper tissue echogenicity for ultrasound imaging. METHODS:
                  Heart phantoms were designed from preoperative imaging of
                  three patients with complex VSDs. Each whole heart phantom,
                  including atrial and ventricular septums, was obtained by
                  manual segmentation and by surface reconstruction, then by
                  molding and by casting in different materials. Heart phantoms
                  in silicone and polyvinyl alcohol cryogel (PVA-C) were
                  considered, and they were reconstructed in 3-D using 2-D
                  freehand ultrasound imaging. RESULTS: An electromagnetic
                  measurement system was used to measure the mean VSD diameters
                  from the heart phantoms. Errors were evaluated below 1.0 mm
                  for mean VSD diameters between 6.2 and 7.5 mm. CONCLUSION:
                  Patient-specific heart phantoms promise for representing
                  complex heart malformations such as VSDs. PVA-C showed better
                  tissue echogenicity than silicone for VSDs visualization and
                  characterization.},

                  develop a soft, high-fidelity and durable liver phantom with
                  detailed morphology. The phantom is anatomically accurate and
                  feasible for the multi-modality medical imaging, including
                  computer tomography (CT), ultrasound, and endoscopy. The CT

                  manufacture. I have been studying handmade ultrasound phantoms
                  and proposed an ultrasound phantom comprising calcium alginate
                  hydrogel that met these requirements but caused a speckle
                  pattern similar to that observed in ultrasound images of
                  liver. In this study, I show that adding ethanol to the
                  precursors used to fabricate the phantom reduces the speckle
                  pattern. The ultrasound propagation velocity and attenuation
                  coefficient of the phantom were 1561 ± 8 m/s and 0.54 ± 0.18
                  dB/cm/MHz, respectively (mean ± standard deviation), which are
                  within the ranges of those in human soft tissues (1530-1600
                  m/s and 0.3-1.0 dB/cm/MHz, respectively). This phantom is easy
                  to fabricate without special equipment, is inexpensive, and is
                  suitable for elementary training on ultrasound diagnosis,
                  operation of ultrasound-guided needles, and blind catheter
                  insertion.},

                  comparison of biomedical imaging devices across vendors and
                  institutions, support the development of internationally
                  recognized standards, and assist the clinical translation of
                  novel technologies. Here, a manufacturing process is presented
                  that results in a stable, low-cost, tissue-mimicking
                  copolymer-in-oil material for use in photoacoustic, optical,
                  and ultrasound standardization efforts. The base material
                  consists of mineral oil and a copolymer with defined Chemical
                  Abstract Service (CAS) numbers. The protocol presented here
                  yields a representative material with a speed of sound c(f) =
                  1,481 ± 0.4 m·s-1 at 5 MHz (corresponds to the speed of sound
                  of water at 20 °C), acoustic attenuation α(f) = 6.1 ± 0.06
                  dB·cm-1 at 5 MHz, optical absorption µa(λ) = 0.05 ± 0.005 mm-1
                  at 800 nm, and optical scattering µs'(λ) = 1 ± 0.1 mm-1 at 800
                  nm. The material allows independent tuning of the acoustic and
                  optical properties by respectively varying the polymer
                  concentration or light scattering (titanium dioxide) and
                  absorbing agents (oil-soluble dye). The fabrication of
                  different phantom designs is displayed and the homogeneity of
                  the resulting test objects is confirmed using photoacoustic
                  imaging. Due to its facile, repeatable fabrication process and
                  durability, as well as its biologically relevant properties,
                  the material recipe has high promise in multimodal

                  cannulation via the traditional landmark approach has become
                  less used in comparison to ultrasound (US) guided internal
                  jugular catheterization due to a higher rate of mechanical
                  complications. A growing body of evidence indicates that SCV
                  catheterization with real-time US guidance can be accomplished
                  safely and efficiently. While several cannulation approaches
                  with real-time US guidance have been described, available
                  literature suggests that the infraclavicular, longitudinal
                  “in-plane” technique may be preferred. This approach allows
                  for direct visualization of needle advancement, which reduces
                  risk of complications and improves successful placement.
                  Infraclavicular SCV cannulation requires simultaneous use of
                  US during needle advancement, but for an inexperienced
                  operator, it is more easily learned compared to the
                  traditional landmark approach. In this article, we review the
                  evidence supporting the use of US guidance for SCV

                  room, bedside ultrasound (BUS) of the neck has shown high
                  accuracy for distinguishing endotracheal (ETI) from esophageal
                  intubations. We sought to determine the accuracy of BUS for
                  endotracheal tube (ETT) position in the emergency department
                  (ED) setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed the utility
                  of BUS in a single-center observational study in an ED
                  setting. BUS was performed either simultaneously with ED
                  intubation (S/ED), within < 3 minutes of ED intubation (A/ED),
                  or in < 3 minutes of patient's ED arrival after pre-hospital
                  intubation (A/EMS). Trained ED providers performed BUS;
                  intubators were blinded to ultrasound findings. We used
                  Cormack and Lehane categories (CL) to classify intubation
                  attempts as "easy" (CL-I/II), "moderate" (CL-III) and
                  "difficult" (CL-IV). Additional data included the diagnostic
                  accuracy of the sonographer and intubator compared to the
                  clinical outcome, anatomy identified by sonography and time to
                  diagnosis. RESULTS: During a 10-month period, 89 subjects with
                  115 intubation attempts were included in the study, and 86
                  patients/101 attempts with complete data were used in the
                  study (63-easy, 19-moderate, 19-difficult). The sonographers
                  achieved 100 \% accuracy with respect to determining the
                  correct ETT position utilizing an anterior neck approach,
                  while the intubators' accuracy in assessing correct tube
                  location was 97 \% compared to the clinical outcome. A blinded
                  review of sonography findings confirmed all BUS anatomical
                  findings. A sonographically empty esophagus was 100 \%
                  specific for endotracheal intubation, and a "double trachea
                  sign" was 100 \% sensitive and 91 \% specific for esophageal
                  intubation. The sonographic time to diagnosis was
                  significantly faster than the intubator time to diagnosis
                  ("easy" p < 0.001; n = 47; "moderate" p = 0.001; n = 15;
                  "difficult" p < 0.001; n = 19); Wilcoxon test; A/EMS cases
                  excluded). CONCLUSION: In this emergency setting, ultrasound
                  determined ETT locations rapidly with 100 \% accuracy and
                  independently of the CL-category.},

                  venous catheter is becoming common practice in many emergency
                  departments in the difficult-to-access patient, and simulation
                  has become an important tool for health care practitioners to
                  learn this technique. Commercial trainers are expensive, and
                  low-cost alternatives described to date provide a sub-optimal
                  training experience. We introduce ballistics gel as a new
                  material for the creation of simulating phantoms. MATERIALS
                  AND METHODS: Directions describe construction of a simulating
                  phantom composed of 10\% ballistic gelatin and commonly
                  available latex tubing. The model's success as used by one
                  residency training program and medical school is described.
                  RESULTS: Cost per phantom was \$22.83, with less than an hour
                  preparation time per phantom. We found these phantoms to offer

                  products and better than other homemade products. DISCUSSION:
                  Ballistics gel is a novel material for production of
                  simulation phantoms that provides a low-cost, realistic
                  simulation experience. The clear gel material works well for
                  novice learners, and opacifying agents can be added to
                  increase difficulty for more advanced learners. The material
                  offers flexibility in design to make models for a broad range
                  of skill instruction. CONCLUSION: A relatively quick and easy
                  process using ballistics gel allowed us to create a simulation
                  experience similar to commercially available trainers at a
                  fraction of the cost.},

                  OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to use a thoracentesis simulation to
                  assess graduating residents' proficiency in thoracentesis
                  procedural skills and to evaluate the impact of an educational
                  intervention on skill development to mastery standards.
                  DESIGN: This was a pretest-posttest mastery learning design
                  without a control group. SETTING: Participants were 40
                  third-year internal medicine residents in a
                  university-affiliated program. INTERVENTION: Using an
                  observational checklist, each resident underwent baseline
                  assessment of thoracentesis skill using a standardized
                  clinical history, radiograph, and thoracentesis simulation.
                  After baseline testing, residents received two 2-hour
                  education sessions featuring a videotaped presentation and
                  deliberate practice with the thoracentesis simulator.
                  MEASUREMENTS: Residents were retested after the intervention.
                  Skill mastery was defined as meeting or exceeding the minimum
                  passing score (MPS) set by an expert panel at thoracentesis
                  posttest. Those who did not achieve the MPS had additional
                  deliberate practice and were retested until the MPS was

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Pericardiocentesis is a low-frequency, high-risk
                  procedure integral to the practice of emergency medicine.
                  Ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis is the preferred
                  technique for providing this critical intervention.
                  Traditionally, emergency physicians learned pericardiocentesis
                  in real time, at the bedside, on critically ill patients.
                  Medical education is moving toward simulation for training and
                  assessment of procedures such as pericardiocentesis because it
                  allows learners to practice time-sensitive skills without risk
                  to patient or learner. The retail market for models for
                  pericardiocentesis practice is limited and expensive.
                  DISCUSSION: We have developed an ultrasound-guided
                  pericardiocentesis task trainer that allows the physician to
                  insert a needle under ultrasound guidance, pierce the
                  "pericardial sac" and aspirate "blood." Our model can be
                  simply constructed in a home kitchen, and the overall
                  preparation time is 1 h. Our model costs \$20.00 (US, 2008).
                  Materials needed for the construction include 16 ounces of
                  plain gelatin, one large balloon, one golf ball, food
                  coloring, non-stick cooking spray, one wooden cooking skewer,
                  surgical iodine solution, and a 4-quart sized plastic food
                  storage container. Refrigeration and a heat source for cooking
                  are also required. Once prepared, the model is usable for 2
                  weeks at room temperature and may be preserved an additional
                  week if refrigerated. When the model shows signs of wear, it
                  can be easily remade, by simply recycling the existing
                  materials. CONCLUSION: The self-made model was well liked by
                  training staff due to accessibility of a simulation model, and
                  by learners of the technique as they felt more at ease
                  performing pericardiocentesis on a live patient.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) is often
                  used to distinguish abscess from cellulitis in superficial
                  soft tissue infections. With the increased use of POCUS in
                  emergency medicine, it is important that training to use POCUS
                  is enhanced by practice using phantom models. OBJECTIVE: To
                  create an easily made, inexpensive, homemade phantom capable
                  of simulating an abscess in superficial soft tissue infection.
                  METHODS: Increasing amounts of Jell-O (Northfield, Illinois,
                  USA) brand gelatin and sugar-free Metamucil (Cincinnati, Ohio,
                  USA) brand psyllium hydrophilic mucilloid fibre were
                  experimented with until a satisfactory model was achieved.
                  Various liquids were injected into it to simulate superficial
                  abscess formation. The desired goal was for the phantom to
                  appear similar to superficial human soft tissue under
                  ultrasound scan and to be firm enough to withstand pressure
                  from an ultrasound probe scan. The goal for the simulated
                  abscess was to appear as a hypoechoic space under ultrasound
                  scan. A Sonosite M-Turbo (Bothell, Washington, USA) bedside
                  ultrasound machine with linear array transducer probe was used
                  for the ultrasound scans. RESULTS: The optimal homemade
                  phantom incorporated 12 tablespoons of Jell-O and four
                  tablespoons of Metamucil in one liter of water. CONCLUSION: An
                  easily made, inexpensive phantom model for instruction on
                  identification of superficial skin abscess was achieved.},

                  pericardial tamponade. The recommended standard treatment of
                  tamponade in various guidelines is pericardiocentesis. As
                  ultrasound guidance lowers the complication rates and
                  increases the patient's safety, pericardiocentesis should be
                  performed under ultrasound guidance. Acute care physicians
                  actually need to train emergency pericardiocentesis. Methods.
                  We describe in detail a pericardiocentesis ultrasound model,
                  using materials at a cost of about 60 euros. During training
                  courses of focused echocardiography n = 67, participants
                  tested the phantom and completed a 16-item questionnaire,
                  assessing the model using a visual analogue scale (VAS).
                  Results. Eleven of fourteen questions were answered with a
                  mean VAS score higher than 60\% and thus regarded as showing
                  the strengths of the model. Unrealistically outer appearance
                  and heart shape were rated as weakness of the model. A total
                  mean VAS score of all questions of 63\% showed that
                  participants gained confidence for further interventions.
                  Conclusions. Our low-cost pericardiocentesis model, which can
                  be easily constructed, may serve as an effective training tool
                  of ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis for acute and critical
                  care physicians.},

  abstract     = {Airway management is a critical skill in the practice of
                  several medical specialities including anesthesia, emergency
                  medicine, and critical care. Over the years mounting evidence
                  has showed an increasing role of ultrasound (US) in airway
                  management. The objective of this narrative review is to
                  provide an overview of the indications for point-of-care
                  ultrasound (POCUS) of the upper airway. The use of US to guide
                  and assist clinical airway management has potential benefits
                  for both provider and patient. Ultrasound can be utilized to
                  determine airway size and predict the appropriate diameter of
                  single-lumen endotracheal tubes (ETTs), double-lumen ETTs, and
                  tracheostomy tubes. Ultrasonography can differentiate
                  tracheal, esophageal, and endobronchial intubation.
                  Ultrasonography of the neck can accurately localize the
                  cricothyroid membrane for emergency airway access and
                  similarly identify tracheal rings for US-guided tracheostomy.
                  In addition, US can identify vocal cord dysfunction and
                  pathology before induction of anesthesia. A rapidly growing
                  body of evidence showing ultrasonography used in conjunction
                  with hands-on management of the airway may benefit patient
                  care. Increasing awareness and use of POCUS for many
                  indications have resulted in technologic advancements and
                  increased accessibility and portability. Upper airway POCUS
                  has the potential to become the first-line non-invasive
                  adjunct assessment tool in airway management.},

                  and provides treatment guidelines in acute critical settings.
                  However, the limitation of using POCUS is operator dependent.
                  Appropriate and validated training for acquiring and using
                  skills in practice must be conducted before using POCUS in
                  clinical settings in order to keep patients safe. Simulation
                  education models have been introduced as a way to solve and
                  overcome these concerns. However, the commercial simulator
                  with sufficiently secured fidelity is expensive and not always
                  available. This review focused on the inexpensive and easily

  abstract     = {PURPOSE: Phantoms are a vital step for the preliminary
                  validation of new image-guided procedures. In this paper, the
                  authors present a deformable prostate phantom for use with
                  multimodal imaging (end-fire or side-fire ultrasound, CT and
                  MRI) and more specifically for transperineal or transrectal
                  needle-insertion procedures. It is made of soft polyvinyl
                  chloride (PVC) plastic and includes a prostate, a perineum, a
                  rectum, a soft periprostatic surrounding and embedded targets
                  for image registration and needle-targeting. Its main
                  particularity is its realistic deformability upon
                  manipulation. METHODS: After a detailed manufacturing
                  description, the imaging and mechanical characteristics of the
                  phantom are described and evaluated. First, the speed of sound
                  and stress-strain relationship of the PVC material used in the
                  phantom are described, followed by an analysis of its storage,
                  imaging, needle-insertion force, and deformability
                  characteristics. RESULTS: The average speed of sound in the
                  phantom was measured to be 1380 ± 20 m/s, while the
                  stress-strain relationship was found to be viscoelastic and in
                  the range of typical prostatic tissues. The mechanical and
                  imaging characteristics of the phantom were found to remain
                  stable at cooler storage temperatures. The phantom had clearly
                  distinguishable morphology in all three imaging modalities,
                  with embedded targets that could be precisely segmented,
                  resulting in an average US-CT rigid registration error of 0.66
                  mm. The mobility of the phantom prostate upon needle insertion
                  was between 2 and 4 mm, with rotations between 0° and 2°,
                  about the US probe head. CONCLUSION: The phantom's
                  characteristics compare favorably with in vitro and in vivo
                  measurements found in the literature. The authors believe that
                  this realistic phantom could be of use to researchers studying
                  new needle-based prostate diagnosis and therapy techniques.},

                  institutions for training purposes. The purpose of this study
                  is to describe an inexpensive and simple method to create
                  ultrasound-imaging models for the purpose of education and
                  practice using clear ballistic gel. METHODS: Clear ballistic
                  gel is used to simulate tissue for firing practice and other
                  military evaluations. RESULTS: The transparent and durable
                  ultrasound phantom we produced was clear and contained four
                  vessel lumens. The images obtained using the phantom were of
                  high quality and compared well to normal sonographic anatomy.
                  CONCLUSIONS: The clear ballistic brand gel is unique because
                  it is inexpensive, does not dry out, does not decay, is
                  odorless, and is reusable. The ultrasound images obtained
                  using the phantom are realistic and useful for ultrasound

                  safe introduction to clinical skills and is associated with
                  improved in-hospital performance. Many materials have been
                  used to simulate human tissue in phantoms including commercial
                  manikins, agar, gelatin, and Ballistics Gel; however, phantom
                  tissues could be improved to provide higher-fidelity
                  ultrasound images or tactile sensation. This article describes
                  a novel phantom tissue mixture of a modified polyvinyl
                  chloride (PVC) polymer, mineral oil, and chalk powder and
                  evaluates needle cutting and ultrasonic properties of the
                  modified PVC polymer mixture compared with a variety of
                  phantom tissues. METHODS: The first experiment measured axial
                  needle forces of a needle insertion into nine phantom
                  materials, including three formulations of modified PVC. The
                  second experiment used a pairwise comparison survey of
                  ultrasound images to determine the perceived realism of
                  phantom ultrasound images. RESULTS: It was found that the
                  materials of Ballistics Gel and one of the PVC mixtures
                  provide stiff force feedback similar to cadaver tissue. Other
                  phantom materials including agar and gelatin provide very weak
                  unrealistic force feedback. The survey results showed the PVC
                  mixtures being viewed as the most realistic by the survey
                  participants, whereas agar and Ballistics Gel were seen as the
                  least realistic. CONCLUSIONS: The realism in cutting force and
                  ultrasound visualization was determined for a variety of
                  phantom materials. Novel modified PVC polymer has great
                  potential for use in ultrasound phantoms because of its
                  realistic ultrasound imaging and modifiable stiffness. This
                  customizability allows for easy creation of multilayer tissue

                  chloride (PVC) can be adjusted to meet the needs of
                  researchers as a tissue-mimicking material. For instance, the
                  hardness can be adjusted by changing the ratio of softener to
                  PVC polymer, mineral oil can be added for lubrication in
                  needle insertion, and glass beads can be added to scatter
                  acoustic energy similar to biological tissue. Through this
                  research, the authors sought to develop a regression model to
                  design formulations of PVC with targeted mechanical and
                  multimodal medical imaging properties. METHODS: The design of
                  experiment was conducted by varying three factors-(1) the
                  ratio of softener to PVC polymer, (2) the mass fraction of
                  mineral oil, and (3) the mass fraction of glass beads-and
                  measuring the mechanical properties (elastic modulus,
                  hardness, viscoelastic relaxation time constant, and needle
                  insertion friction force) and the medical imaging properties
                  [speed of sound, acoustic attenuation coefficient, magnetic
                  resonance imaging time constants T(1) and T(2), and the
                  transmittance of the visible light at wavelengths of 695 nm
                  (T(λ695)) and 532 nm (T(λ532))] on twelve soft PVC samples. A
                  regression model was built to describe the relationship
                  between the mechanical and medical imaging properties and the
                  values of the three composition factors of PVC. The model was
                  validated by testing the properties of a PVC sample with a
                  formulation distinct from the twelve samples. RESULTS: The
                  tested soft PVC had elastic moduli from 6 to 45 kPa,
                  hardnesses from 5 to 50 Shore OOO-S, viscoelastic stress
                  relaxation time constants from 114.1 to 191.9 s, friction

                  times from 426.3 to 450.2 ms, T(2) relaxation times from 21.5
                  to 28.4 ms, T(λ695) from 46.8\% to 92.6\%, and T(λ532) from
                  41.1\% to 86.3\%. Statistically significant factors of each
                  property were identified. The regression model relating the
                  mechanical and medical imaging properties and their
                  corresponding significant factors had a good fit. The
                  validation tests showed a small discrepancy between the model
                  predicted values and experimental data (all less than 5\%
                  except the needle insertion friction force). CONCLUSIONS: The
                  regression model developed in this paper can be used to design
                  soft PVC with targeted mechanical and medical imaging
                  properties.},

  abstract     = {The polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tissue-mimicking material for
                  needle insertion was manufactured and evaluated. Factorial
                  design of experiment was conducted by changing three factors −
                  the ratio of softener and PVC polymer solution, the mass
                  fraction of mineral oil, and the mass fraction of micro-sized
                  glass beads − to study the indentation hardness, compression
                  elastic modulus and friction and cutting forces in needle
                  insertion of 12 types of soft PVC material. The indentation
                  hardness of the soft PVC material ranged from 5 to 50. The
                  elastic modulus of the soft PVC material was from 6 to 45 kPa
                  between 0-0.15 strain. The friction and cutting force during
                  needle insertion also had large ranges, which were from 0.005
                  to 0.086 N/mm and 0.04 to 0.36 N respectively. The analysis of
                  variance showed that the ratio of softener and PVC polymer
                  solution had the most significant effect on all of the four
                  properties of the PVC material. The percentage of mineral oil
                  also had statistical significance on these four properties.
                  The glass beads only had effect on the needle insertion
                  cutting force. A nonlinear regression model was applied to
                  find relationships among mechanical properties and the
                  significant factors. The R2 values of the regression analysis
                  results were all larger than 0.9. Four properties of a PVC
                  tissue-mimicking material can be designed to desired values
                  based on these relationships.},
